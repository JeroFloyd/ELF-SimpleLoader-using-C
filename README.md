SimpleLoader: An ELF Loader in C from Scratch (Without Bonus)

We have implemented a SimpleLoader for loading an ELF 32-bit executable in plain-C without using any
library APIs available for manipulating ELF files.

Me and my teammate Aryan Verma have completed the Assignment-1 SimpleLoader - An ELF Loader in C from Scratch. We met in the library after our classes got over and worked together to complete this assignment in my laptop. 
I would say that we both have contributed equally and worked pretty hard on this assignment as a team.
